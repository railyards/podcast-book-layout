## Podcasting

Listening to podcast is great while you are commuting, cleaning, trying to sleep or wanting to get your mind off things.

## Technical aspects I

I recommend you download an **app** where you can subscribe to podcasts. On Android, I use **Stitcher** and **Podcast Addict**. For Apple users, the **Apple Podcast** app is usually installed on their iPhone, but they can also use Stitcher.

## Technical aspects II 
In the app, you will be able to subscribe to podcasts of your interest. Then, when a new episode is released, it will be added to the list of podcasts. You can choose to automatically download every new episode or to just download specific episodes.
